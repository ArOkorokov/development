                    <p class="technical__bottom-text1">Let’s recap! <strong>Building a successful website</strong> and brand requires a team of experts: photographer, video director, content creator, </strong>web designer, brand designer, marketing specialist, SMM expert, front-end and back-end developers, and SEO specialist.</strong> Blogs and e-commerce sites may also require full-time support staff.</p>
                    <p class="technical__bottom-text2">The main takeaway is that mistakes can be costly — often doubling your website costs — and are hard to spot and even harder to fix. In some cases, building a website from scratch is the best option. Choose your contractors wisely.</p>
